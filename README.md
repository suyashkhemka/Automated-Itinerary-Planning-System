# Automated-Itinerary-Planning-System

Today most of the people love to travel but traveling is not as simple as choosing destinations randomly and visiting them one by one. What we need is an itinerary which is a plan that displays how you will get from one point to another and when you will be at each point. A travel itinerary is a schedule of events relating to planned travel, generally including destinations to be visited at specified times.
A travel itinerary should effectively manage your travel time to certain numerous attractions while at the same time considering all constraints and unforeseen circumstances such as traffic, opening and closing timings of a destination. Also the itinerary should select each customerâ€™s preferred destinations instead of picking up the most popular destinations as ultimately every person has different tastes and each customer should be satisfied with his own itinerary. 
In this project, an itinerary plan is generated based on the user entered choices of places. The user specifies his available free slots in a day, the type of destinations such as monuments, nature or arts, the type of food such as Indian, Mexican, Italian or Chinese, locations from where he wants to start and end the trip. After considering all these choices, we prepare a plan best suited for the customer so that the customer can travel with a proper plan and do not waste his time and resources.
